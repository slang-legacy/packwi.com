  h1 what our clients are saying about us

  mixin full_testi('Elizabeth M', 'San Francisco, CA', 'Our cross-country shipment arrived right on time (and quickly) and everything was well-packed and in excellent condition.')
  mixin full_testi('Sholem', '', "I meant to write earlier -- but what with preparing for my show, and then going down to New York, I've been very preoccupied. But I did want to let you know how much I appreciated my experience with you and The Packaging Store, from the initial phone call to the delivery of the shipment. After going through hell's half-acre just trying to find a freight company that would handle artwork, everyone I dealt with at The Packaging Store was friendly and helpful on the phone, responsive and prompt through email, and generally made the planning stages of the shipment a breeze. Your delivery-men showed up exactly when they said they would, were professional and respectful with my shipment (which is no small thing when we're talking about original artworks). The crates (and, needless to say, the paintings inside) arrived in perfect condition at the gallery, in exactly the time that was quoted to me. <br/><br/> So I wanted to let you and everyone in your office that I was extremely pleased with the service at The Packaging Store. I will absolutely recommend you to any of my artist friends who need shippers, and you can rest assured that I will definitely be using your services for any future art shipping that I might need to do.")
  mixin full_testi('Denise Parri', 'Director of White Space, A Fine Art Gallery, New Haven, CT', "You are the 'worry free' transportation masters.")
  mixin full_testi('Giuseppe Concepcion', 'Proarte Gallery', 'Thank you for shipping our artwork so carefully. I felt like a kid at Christmas... it took me 45 minutes to open the box. In my 20 years in the art business, I have never seen anything so well packed.')
  mixin full_testi('Antonio Elago', 'Earthlink', 'The staff at The Packaging Store are experts when it comes to packaging sensitive electronic equipment and really go the extra mile when it comes to customer service.')
  mixin full_testi('Steve Croy', 'Virgin Entertainment Group', 'I occasionally find myself in need of bulk shipping services for some rather oddly shaped, large and heavy technology components to our various technology co-locations and retail stores all across the country. The Packaging Store has provided excellent prompt response, efficient and sound packing, no matter what the size, shape or weight, as well as outstanding turn around, shipping and as promised delivery. After doing some comparison-shopping, I have found no other company can beat The Packaging Store in terms of value and service. I am very glad I found The Packaging Store and will definitely call upon them again in the future.')
  mixin full_testi('John MacIntyre', 'MCSP', 'I received the crated equipment in excellent order and was VERY impressed with the professional service.')
  mixin full_testi('Angie', '', 'We are really happy with the service we have been getting from you and your team - this is the fourth server shipment with you for this specific project and there has not been a single issue. All the feedback I have received from the team here is that you guys are great to work with, your team is all highly reliable and know what they are doing, you have a very good secure and safe process and just do things right.')
  mixin full_testi('Joy & Breck Johnson', '', 'I just wanted to let you know our furniture arrived today. It looks great! I just wanted to express how pleased my husband and I were with the packing of the furniture. We were so impressed with the care you took to insure that everything was secure, custom fit, and to even put protective film over the glass doors and the mirrored back of the Secretary Hutch. It was more than we expected and we knew we had made the right choice in going with your company. Thank you for the wonderful customer service and making this transaction so easy for me all the way in Lexington. Again, I just wanted to let you know how impressed we were and that if we ever have to ship anything again we will definitely go with The Packaging Store. I also recommended your services to Steve in case he has any other pieces of furniture to ship.')
  mixin full_testi('Elizabeth Nguyen', '', 'I wanted to thank you so much for helping me with my move.<br/><br/>I know that moving is anything but stress-free but I was glad that you were there to take much of the burden off my shoulders. <br/><br/>Not only was I confident that my things would arrive safely during the time scheduled, I really appreciate you going out of your way in finding me a more than fair price. And when problems arose and I had to rescheduled my drop-off, I was so glad that you were able to rearrange things to make my move more convenient. I would not hesitate to recommend you to any of my friends or family.<br/><br/>I hope you know that you provide a service that is badly needed with a quality anyone can be more than proud of. Everything arrived to its new home safely, that is, until I got it out of the box and broke it myself.')
  mixin full_testi('Darin K. Lawson', 'CAAI', "I am the recipient of a recent shipment of 7 paintings you crated and shipped for a customer named Phil Desch. They were very pleased with the service they received at your location, and I referred them to you because of our good experience with the The Packaging Store representative here. I am encouraged that it appears all your locations have the same quality service! I also appreciate the fact that you shipped all 7 paintings in two, well-packaged crates, rather than creating a crate for each piece (which I've seen other franchise shippers do), which is a terrible waste of time and money, as it appears you are aware. Thanks again for providing good service.")
  mixin full_testi('Mike Kilpatrick', '', 'I just returned tonight from my trip to San Diego, where I set up the system you shipped. I have never seen a finer job of packing, even from the vendor when these systems shipped as new. I most certainly will call upon your company when the system is returned and will consider you in my future freight needs.')
