# packwi.com
A simple corporate website for Handle with Care, The Packaging Store. This site is now retired, and has been moved to [packwi.slang.cx](http://packwi.slang.cx). Feel free to do whatever you want with it... It's a pretty good example site and the Jade code is easy to read.

## how to compile it
Use [roots](http://roots.cx).
